Here's the description for a poster session for PyCon 2011 in Atlanta, GA.



Title: Interactions with Python and Kinect

Description: Python, Kinect and Arduino are excellent tools to interact with the physical world. Using them, a small, interactive robot is being created to showcase skills and techniques that can be learned at The Crucible, a non-profit industrial arts education center located in Oakland, CA.

Type: Poster

Abstract: In 2010, Microsoft introduced the Kinect for use with their Xbox 360. It provides a set of sensors that allow people to interact with a game without using a controller. Soon after it's release, Adafruit Industries created a bounty for open source drivers to allow anyone to use the Kinect for other purposes. Within a week, the first open source drivers were released.

The robot is being created using Python, a computer, a Kinect, stainless steel, an Arduino microcontroller, servo motors, a bill acceptor, a solenoid valve, a spark plug and a neon transformer. Using the Kinect to locate the closest person, the eyes of the robot track the person as they remain in its field of vision. Using pre-recorded sentences, the robot attempts to interact with the person and encourages them to make a donation.

This session will discuss the use of Python to extract working data from a Kinect, communicating with an Arduino controller and techniques for real world interactions.

Audience level: Experienced

Submitting speaker: Peter Kropf




details
=======

hardware
--------

computer, arduino, kinect, servos, solid state relay, switches, bill acceptor, solenoid, propane, neon transformer, spark plug, recycled stainless steel.

computer - connected to kinect and arduino; running ubuntu 10.10 64bit, python; polls arduino for depth and rgb feeds, parses depth for closest point, calculates angles for servos, sends message to arduino to move servos; pulls bill acceptor and trip switch data; saves depth, video, donation amount, kinect time, system time.

arduino board - sketches, controlling servos, sensing input, communicating via usb / serial w/ computer.

servos - 2 servos / eye.

stainless - recycled materials from bayer pharmaceuticals in emeryville, ca.

poofer - stainless tank, 120 volt solenoid, propane fuel source w/ regulator, spark plug for ignition, solid state relay controlled by arduino to activate solenoid and igintion.
