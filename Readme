Exuro

Exuro is a small robot that uses an arduino to control 4 servo motors that move a pair of gimbal based eyes, it uses a Kinect to find interesting things to focus the eyes on and controls a small propane based fire poofer through a solid state relay connected to the arduino.


Other Notes
===========

Using Hextronik HX5010 servos. Orange is control, red is power and brown is ground.

The code running on the Arduino board and the Python code interfacing with it were originally based on the work of Brian D. Wendt at http://principialabs.com/. The code came from his project at: http://principialabs.com/arduino-python-4-axis-servo-control/.
