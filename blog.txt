notes for a blog posting on this project

using arduino interrupts

    need to tie the interrupt pin to ground (or +5) via a 1k resistor. otherwise, the wire will act like an antenna and cause stray interrupts to trigger

    using a toggle (x = ~x) isn't good since it's possible to loose (or have an additional) interrupt. use an interrupt handler on change and then read the interrupt pin value to make a decision.


arduino and servos

    1 servo powered by the arduino is ok, 2 will cause the arduino to reset once in a while, 3 or more will cause the arduino to reset frequently. happens because the multiple servos draw too much power, to the point where the arduino is not getting enough power to run and will rest.


background

    stainless steel donation bot

    4 servos driving a pair of 2 axis gimbals to mimic eyes

    solid state relay to control the poofer (solenoid and ignition spark)

    apex 5400 bill acceptor 

    asco 1/2" solenoid to release propane

    kinect to detect people and movement

    computer to process kinect, provide sound and send commands to arduino over usb


issues

    alignment and orientation of servos

    ignition - pilot vs spark plug vs silicon nitride
